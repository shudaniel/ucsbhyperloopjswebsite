               text="The Hyperloop is a new and futuristic mode of transportation proposed by Elon Musk in which a magnetically levitating pod is suspended in a low-pressure tube. Passengers or freight are loaded into the vehicle and accelerated to speeds nearly 200mph faster than that of a commercial jet. This means that a trip from San Francisco to LA - one that could take 7 hours or more by car – is now a 30 minute hyperloop ride!"

Last year’s UCSB Hyperloop team was a large group of determined undergraduate engineers working, levitating hyperloop pod as their senior design project. Of the several hundred colleges that applied to compete in the 2017 Hyperloop Competition at SpaceX, UCSB was one of 25 selected to attend the competition weekend."
